  HOW TO SET UP IQR-SHIPSTATION CONNECTOR FOR CLIENTS
  (Step-by-Step Guide - No Technical Knowledge Required)
================================================================================

📋 WHAT THIS DOES:
This software automatically syncs orders between IQ Reseller and ShipStation.
When you get an order in IQ Reseller, it automatically creates it in ShipStation.
When ShipStation ships an order, it automatically updates the tracking in IQ Reseller.


================================================================================
STEP 1: GET YOUR API KEYS (PASSWORDS FOR THE SOFTWARE)
================================================================================

🔑 FROM IQ RESELLER:
1. Log into IQ Reseller website
2. Go to Settings → API Settings (or ask IQ Reseller support)
3. Copy your "API Key" - it's a long string of letters and numbers
4. Save it in a notepad - you'll need it later

🔑 FROM SHIPSTATION:
1. Log into ShipStation website
2. Click on your name (top right) → Account Settings
3. Click "API Settings" on the left menu
4. You'll see two things:
   - API Key (looks like: a1b2c3d4e5f6...)
   - API Secret (looks like: x9y8z7w6v5u4...)
5. Copy BOTH and save them in notepad


================================================================================
STEP 2: DOWNLOAD THE SOFTWARE
================================================================================

1. Go to: https://github.com/AgentsLogic/iqr-shipstation-connector

2. Click the green "Code" button

3. Click "Download ZIP"

4. Save it to your computer (like your Desktop or Documents folder)

5. Right-click the ZIP file → "Extract All"

6. You now have a folder called "iqr-shipstation-connector-main"


================================================================================
STEP 3: INSTALL NODE.JS (THE ENGINE THAT RUNS THE SOFTWARE)
================================================================================

1. Go to: https://nodejs.org

2. Click the big green button that says "Download Node.js (LTS)"

3. Run the installer you just downloaded

4. Click "Next" → "Next" → "Next" → "Install"

5. Wait for it to finish

6. Click "Finish"

7. Restart your computer (important!)


================================================================================
STEP 4: SET UP YOUR API KEYS
================================================================================

1. Open the folder you extracted in Step 2

2. Find the file called ".env.example"

3. Right-click it → "Open with" → "Notepad"

4. You'll see something like this:

   PORT=3001
   NODE_ENV=production
   IQR_API_KEY=your_iqr_api_key_here
   IQR_AUTH_URL=https://signin.iqreseller.com
   SHIPSTATION_API_KEY=your_shipstation_api_key_here
   SHIPSTATION_API_SECRET=your_shipstation_api_secret_here
   ...

5. Replace the parts that say "your_xxx_here" with your actual keys:
   
   - Replace "your_iqr_api_key_here" with the IQ Reseller key you saved
   - Replace "your_shipstation_api_key_here" with ShipStation API Key
   - Replace "your_shipstation_api_secret_here" with ShipStation API Secret

6. Click File → Save As

7. Change the filename from ".env.example" to just ".env"
   (Make sure it's ".env" NOT ".env.txt")

8. Save it in the same folder

9. Close Notepad


================================================================================
STEP 5: INSTALL THE SOFTWARE
================================================================================

1. Press the Windows key on your keyboard

2. Type "cmd" and press Enter
   (A black window will open - this is called Command Prompt)

3. Type this command and press Enter:
   cd Desktop\iqr-shipstation-connector-main
   
   (If you extracted the folder somewhere else, replace "Desktop" with that location)

4. Type this command and press Enter:
   npm install

5. Wait... it will download a bunch of stuff (this takes 1-2 minutes)

6. When it's done, you'll see a message and the cursor will be blinking again


================================================================================
STEP 6: START THE SOFTWARE
================================================================================

1. In the same black Command Prompt window, type:
   npm start

2. Press Enter

3. You should see a fancy box that says:
   "IQ Reseller ↔ ShipStation Connector"
   "Server running on port 3001"

4. ✅ IT'S WORKING! Leave this window open.

⚠️ IMPORTANT: Don't close this black window! If you close it, the software stops.


================================================================================
STEP 7: TEST IF IT'S WORKING
================================================================================

1. Open your web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, etc.)

2. Go to: http://localhost:3001/health

3. You should see something like:
   {"status":"healthy","timestamp":"2026-01-09..."}

4. ✅ If you see that, everything is working!

5. Go to: http://localhost:3001/health/detailed

6. This will test if it can connect to IQ Reseller and ShipStation

7. You should see:
   "iqr": "up"
   "shipstation": "up"

8. ✅ If both say "up", you're all set!


================================================================================
STEP 8: MAKE IT RUN AUTOMATICALLY (OPTIONAL BUT RECOMMENDED)
================================================================================

Right now, the software only runs when you have that black window open.
To make it run automatically when your computer starts:

OPTION A - EASY WAY (Windows Task Scheduler):

1. Press Windows key + R

2. Type: taskschd.msc and press Enter

3. Click "Create Basic Task" on the right

4. Name: "IQR ShipStation Connector"

5. Click Next → Select "When the computer starts" → Next

6. Select "Start a program" → Next

7. Click Browse and find: C:\Program Files\nodejs\node.exe

8. In "Add arguments" type: 
   C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\Desktop\iqr-shipstation-connector-main\dist\index.js

9. Click Next → Finish

10. Restart your computer to test


OPTION B - EASIER WAY (Use PM2 - Recommended for servers):

1. In Command Prompt, type:
   npm install -g pm2

2. Press Enter and wait for it to install

3. Type:
   npm run build

4. Press Enter and wait

5. Type:
   pm2 start ecosystem.config.js

6. Type:
   pm2 save

7. Type:
   pm2 startup

8. Copy the command it shows you and paste it, then press Enter

9. ✅ Done! It will now run automatically even after restarts


================================================================================
TROUBLESHOOTING - IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG
================================================================================

❌ "Cannot find module" error:
   → Go back to Step 5 and run "npm install" again

❌ "Port 3001 is already in use":
   → Something else is using that port
   → In the .env file, change PORT=3001 to PORT=3002

❌ "IQR authentication failed":
   → Check your IQR_API_KEY in the .env file
   → Make sure you copied it correctly (no extra spaces)

❌ "ShipStation authentication failed":
   → Check your SHIPSTATION_API_KEY and SHIPSTATION_API_SECRET
   → Make sure you copied both correctly

❌ Black window closes immediately:
   → There's an error in your .env file
   → Open .env and check all the values are correct

❌ "npm is not recognized":
   → Node.js didn't install correctly
   → Go back to Step 3 and reinstall Node.js
   → Make sure to restart your computer after


================================================================================
HOW TO KNOW IT'S WORKING
================================================================================

✅ The black Command Prompt window is open and shows the server running

✅ When you go to http://localhost:3001/health you see "healthy"

✅ Orders from IQ Reseller appear in ShipStation automatically

✅ When you ship in ShipStation, tracking updates in IQ Reseller


================================================================================
